title: Apocalypse
---

A thinking from the experience with *the world* as morally corrupt, politically insecure, socially hostile, and full of injustice and hedonism.

Engaging *the world *in apocalyptic terms means to proclaim the *status quo *of *the world *is coming to an end, and to image a new reality is possible.

The proclamation of subversion of *status quo *is that the postcolonial condition of the pentecostal/evangelical life does not need to continue. In pentecostal/evangelical thinking, it shows in the expectation of divine intervention in the business of *the world* through the phenomenon of revival. Proclamation, and revival, for that matters, is taxing, so it cannot represent a constant mode of engaging *the world*. It needs a balance of outward disruption and inward construction.

The imagination of a new reality is possible, even in a state of inequality. Learning from postcolonial theology, imagination is suggested to happen in a kenotic space, which is non-hierarchical and non-dualistic. The social location resists a hasting use of kenosis in terms of self-emptying and self-abnegation.

Thì là mà dữ quá, để mai viết tiếp. Ý tứ thì đầy đủ, nhưng diễn đạt thì vẫn còn quá rối rắm.
